//This code has been modified from the original found at https://www.atlas-scientific.com/_files/code/multi-UART-mega-4.pdf 
//Author of modified code: Dallas Elleman serotonin@cox.net, 1/7/2017. Current UART code allows serial input from keyboard, new code will automate the process of command entry
//and allow for automatic initialization of sensors, averaging of data, and output of average pH, EC, ORP and DO readings.

//This sample code was written on an Arduino MEGA 2560.
//It will allow you to control up to 4 Atlas Scientific devices through 1 serial RX/TX line.
//To open a channel (marked on the board as PRB 1 to PRB 4) send the number of the channel, a colon and the command ending with a carriage return.

//1:r<CR>
//2:i<CR>
//3:c<CR>
//4:r<CR>

//To open a channel and not send a command just send the channel number followed by a colon.

//1:<CR>
//3:<CR>
